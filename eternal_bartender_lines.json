    "Eternal Bartender: 'Stay as long as the torches burn, but leave before the bats return.'",
    "Eternal Bartender: 'Glowcap stew or spiced meat? We've both bubbling over the hearth.'",
    "Eternal Bartender: 'Our ale's brewed from cavern grain, strong enough to wake the dead.'",
    "Eternal Bartender: 'Keep your weapon sheathed; the stone echoes carry sound to strange places.'",
    "Eternal Bartender: 'No fights in the tavern — the stalactites above don't like loud noises.'",
    "Eternal Bartender: 'Careful with the Spirits of the Depths, one sip and you'll see shadows dance.'",
    "Eternal Bartender: 'Mind your step; the stone floor's slick with cavern mist.'"
